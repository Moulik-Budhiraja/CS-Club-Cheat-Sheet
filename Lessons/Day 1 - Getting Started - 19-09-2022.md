### Print Statement

We can use the print function to print out a string to the console. The print function can be used to print out any type of data, not just strings.

```py
print("Hello World")
```

### Variables

Variables are used to store data. We can use variables to store strings, numbers, and more. We can also use variables to store the output of functions.

```py
x = 5
y = "Hello World"
z = 5.5
```

### Comments

Comments are used to explain code. They are not run by the interpreter. We can use comments to explain what our code does.

```py
# This is a single line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line
comment
"""
```

### Input

We can use the input function to get input from the user. The input function will **_always_** return a string.

```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
```

### If Statement

The if statement is used to run code if a condition is true.

```py
if x > 5:
    print("x is bigger then 5")
```
