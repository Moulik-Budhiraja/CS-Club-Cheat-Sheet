-   [Text Adventure Game](#text-adventure-game)

### Text Adventure Game

Today you will be creating a text adventure game. You can use all of the knowledge you have learned so far to create your game. You can use the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) to find out how to use any functions that you don't know how to use. You can also use the [Python cheat sheet](/README.md) to find out how to refer back to any of the lessons. Google and Stack Overflow are also good resources for finding out how to solve any problems you encounter.

Have fun and good luck! We will be looking forward to seeing your games.
